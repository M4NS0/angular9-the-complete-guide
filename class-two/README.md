## Components ##


```sh
    ng generate component newComponent
    # or
    ng g c newComponent
    # or
    ng g c newComponent -d
    # -d meaning dryRun
    # The command will stop the CLI from making any 
    # changes to the file system.  So  if  you  are 
    # unsure about  what  some  command  does,  you 
    # can test it  with  --dry-run  and  not  worry 
    # it will break something in  your  application.
